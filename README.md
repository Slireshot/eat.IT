# eat.IT
Magic web-app made to digitalize the full process of a restaurant. Made by some French guys in IT engineering school

1. Features
  * Waiters can take commands using a light Android / iOS tablet
  * Kitchen gets an intelligent display of orders
  * Managers can adjust the table layout and keep it online for waiters to use it
  * Many statistics are being available as soon as the customer walks in, displaying how much time he's gonna wait if the room is crowded
  * Much, much more inside the app. Git clone it and experience it by yourself !
  
2. Technologies

  As we all study in an IT engineering school, we thought doing a web-app using J2EE or PHP wouldn't be enough, as we had high expectations for eat.IT, both in terms of deployability (available on all devices) and reactivity, as restaurants are often places where speed is needed in all parts of the global process.
  Thus, we chose to use Meteor, as Javascript Client / Serveur Framework, based on :
  * Angular JS
  * MongoDB
  * Node.js
  * React
  * NPM
  * Cordova
